# calculator

Done as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is designed to function exactly like a desk calculator. I attempted quite a few additional features that were not part of the original Odin Project assignment. As such, there are a good number of bugs with its features. As this was a practice exercise, there is no intent to go back and fix them, but the project will be left public.
